# Created by Phoenixilva (Shay Rossignol)

Command-line based and written in Python 2.7.

This game is experimental only and is still in very early development. 
More of a test of what I have learned and to expand upon my skills.

You can download either the 'Experimental_Game.py file and run it with 
'python Experimental_Game.py' from the command-line if you have Python installed.

Otherwise you can download the 'Experimental_Game.exe' and play it that way.

You may edit or distribute this code in any way.
